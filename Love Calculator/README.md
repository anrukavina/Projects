# Exercise description
The **Love Calculator** is based on a game that everyone played when they were kids. To get a result that tells us how many chances we have of developing love with our crush, we had to follow the following steps.

1. Write your name and the name of your crush on a piece of paper.
2. After that, under each letter write how many times it is repeated.
3. Add the first number under your name and the last number under the name of your crush, and repeat with each subsequent number.
4. When you finish with the first line, move on to adding the numbers in the second line, and then in the third.
5. At the end, when you get the total in the fourth line, you will find out what percent chance you have of developing love with your crush.

The closer you are to number 100, the better! Good luck!
